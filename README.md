## 📌 Introduction:-
Phony News Classifier is a repository which contains analysis of a Natural Language Processing application i.e fake news classifier with the help of various text preprocessing strategies like Bag of words,TFIDF Vectorizer,Lemmatization,Stemming with Naive bayes and other deep learning RNN (LSTM) and maintaining the detailed accuracy below.

## ✔Accuracy With Multinomial Naive Bayes✔:-
| Text Preprocessing Type              | Multinomial NB      |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| TFIDF Vectorizer + PorterStemmer     | 92.98%              |
| CountVectorizer + PorterStemmer      | 93.18%              |
| CountVectorizer + WordnetLemmatizer  | %              | 
| TFIDF Vectorizer + WordnetLemmatizer | %              |
